Missing values in the 'Amount' column are removed.
The data type of the 'Amount' column is converted to integers.
Data Exploration:

Bar charts show that most buyers are female, and females also have higher purchasing power.
Age Analysis:
The most active buyers are females aged 26-35.
State Analysis:
Top 10 states by the number of orders and total sales are identified.
Marital Status Analysis:
Married individuals, particularly women, have higher purchasing power.
Occupation Analysis:
Most buyers work in occupations like IT, Healthcare, and Aviation.
Product Category Analysis:
Top product categories by sales amount are identified.
The most sold products are highlighted.
Visualizations:

Various bar plots and count plots are created using Seaborn to visualize the data distribution and trends across different demographics and product categories.
Conclusion:

The analysis concludes that married women aged 26-35 from states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
This EDA provides insights into customer behavior, which can inform marketing strategies and product targeting for future Diwali sales campaigns.
